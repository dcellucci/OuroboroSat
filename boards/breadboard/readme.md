##Breadboard Ouroboros

Ouroboros can be assembled on a breadboard to quickly test whether it works with your project without having to order the finished board. 

The breadboard prototype consists of:

 * Arduino Pro Mini (3.3 V, 8 Mhz, ATMega 328P)
 * LiPo Battery (> 800 mAh capacity)
 * LiPo Fuel Gauge (MAX17043)
 * MPPT Solar Charger (LT3652)
 * P-Channel MOSFET (NDP-6020P)
 * Step-Up Converter (Pololu U3V12F9)

Almost all of the parts are available from Sparkfun ([wishlist](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/112185)) for less than $100 (USD), including the breadboard and jumper wires. The only piece missing is the DC-DC boost converter, which can be purchased from [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2116).
