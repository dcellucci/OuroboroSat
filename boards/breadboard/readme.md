##Breadboard Ouroboros

Ouroboros can be assembled on a breadboard to quickly test whether it works with your project without having to order the finished board. All of the parts are available from Sparkfun, for less than $100 (USD), including the breadboard and jumper wires. Check out the [wishlist](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/112185) for most of the parts. The only piece missing is the DC-DC boost converter, which can be purchased from [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2116).
